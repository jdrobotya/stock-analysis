# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of this project is  to identify which alternative energy stock showed the best preformence in 2017 and 2018. 
Based on the results, we should make a recomendation which stock Steve's parents should invesed into. 
Initially they were planing to invest all savings into  DQ stocks. Steve's goal is to analyze the makret and then deversify the funds. 
As a part of the coding challange for this module, I'll have to refactor code to improve the run time. 


## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, 
as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Based on the 2017 stock market analysis, I'd  recomend Steve's parents to diversify funds and invest in these 3 companies: DQ, ENPH and FSLR. 
They showed more hten 100% return in 2017.

Based on the 2018 stock market analysis, I'd  recomend Steve's parents to diversify funds and invest in these 2 companies: ENPH and  Run. 
They showed  some growth in 2018, when all other companies's returns  droped significantly.

##### If we analyze this data in 2 years dinamic, I'd not  recomend Steve's parents not to invest into DQ Stocks. 
As we see,  DQ's stocks had a significant growth in 2017, but droped in 2018 lower then 60%. 

Insted my recomendation would be to diversify funds and invest in 2 companies that shows constant growth: RUN and ENPH. 
RUN: 2017 (5.5%), 2018 (84%)
ENPH: 2018 (129%, 2018 (81.9%) 


## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

I'll start with one big advantage - the refacrored code runs faster then te initial code. 
Initial coderun time was  3.84 sec for 2017 data and 	3.86 sec for 2018. 
Refactored code run time was 0.88 sec	 for both 2018 and 2017.

I think when you edit the already written code, you develop your critical thinking and ettention to deteils. 
The code needs to be very well formated and have comments, so it's easy to read through. 

I would say that disadvantage is that you need to study code all over again. 
One small change might cause a lot of issues/errors and it might take more time time to fix the error, then the benefir you get from inproving it. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

I was working on the original code the same day I did Module 2 challenge,
so I knew my code very well and could easily recall what each line of code was written for. 
If I did module excercise and challage excersise 2 weeks apart, it would take me nuch more time to refactor the code. 

Reduction in the  run time after refactoring was significan and I think worth the efforts.
